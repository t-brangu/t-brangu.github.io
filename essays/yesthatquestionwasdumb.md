I can't speak for everyone, but I want to believe in our lives, every single person has come across "dumb" questions. Which is a surprising thought as in our modern world, with the press of a button or voice prompt, an AI can be used to answer whatever thought you may currently have. Perhaps you say, "Hey Siri, how many inches are in a foot?", and in return, the voice will say "12 inches are in a foot." It's really that easy! However, still in our everyday lives, perhaps ingrained into our minds as social creatures, people often will still ask questions that can be easily looked up. Maybe it makes having small-talk easier, maybe it's more convenient to ask a friend who can do the thinking and work for you, or maybe, people are not aware that the questions they are asking are not *smart questions*. In classroom settings, we always practice the notion that there are no dumb questions. That's perfectly fine and understandable as people should be encouraged to learn and not discouraged. Though, you won't be penalized for asking dumb questions, there should also be acknowledgement of "smart" questions. It's why we also are quick to point out when questions are good when speaking to others. The reality is, if you really needed that burning question answered, the quickest and most efficient way would be to open up any search engine yourself and look it up. Perhaps it takes you a few minutes to find exactly what you are looking for, but one single search could open your eyes to a vast sea of readily available information.

So what constitutes a smart question? In [*"How to ask questions the smart way" by Eric Raymond*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), he creates a list of qualities and attributes that make up what could be considered a smart question or a dumb question. It's an expansive read with many great points. Some notable ones that I thought were interesting were avoiding grovelling, asking about the goal not the step, and providing symptoms rather than assumptions. Though these can be specifically referring to coding-related questions, I think these points I pointed out are ones that I wish I saw utilized more in our daily conversations and questions. Often when friends will ask me to answer something they might need help on, it can be annoying to constantly hear a question lead with phrases such as "Oh you're just so much better than me at this...", or "It's too difficult and I'm really bad"; any form of grovelling. Naturally, I'm inclined to answer any question someone may have for me to the best of my ability, but please don't use excuses as justifications for asking questions, it's likely unnecessary. Next, asking about the goal and providing symptoms versus guesses are two concepts that I think go hand-in-hand. Including in your questions, what you expect or need, is really important as it narrows down exactly what you could be looking for. Asking open-ended questions or not having a clear goal in mind leaves too many room for possibility for getting an unsatisfactory answer. Providing uninformed assumptions can also be seen as unnecessary as people who are capable of answering your questions can do so without it.

In relation to coding, specifically Software Engineering, it is imperative that we are always trying to ask smart questions. As mentioned, the internet is a really powerful tool and being able to ask smart questions on places such as *Stack Overflow*, a forum in which developers can ask questions and receive answers from other developers, ensures that any potential bugs, errors, or difficulties we may encounter can be handled in an efficient manner. Especially when there can be so many working parts to one's code, it's crucial that the questions we are asking are of smart quality, so that they may be answered as specifically as possible.

## Example of a "Smart" Question

A question that immediately caught my eye because of the post's title is from the user *k9yosh*, posted on September 12th, 2025, reads as: ["Spring Batch jobs failing with duplicate key / serialization errors after upgrading to Spring Boot 3"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79762532/spring-batch-jobs-failing-with-duplicate-key-serialization-errors-after-upgrad)

The reason that this post grabbed my attention is because the title described a specific problem and symptom of that problem. Compared to some of the other questions I have seen, this one seemed like it had a clear goal in mind. It's evident that the issue has to do with an error, so the assumed question is to simply fix it. There's no vagueness from the start and it includes the specific framework being used. If I had similar issues with the framework, by simply typing the name of it in, I'd be able to find this post. 

When opening the post the user gives us a lengthy description that includes the previous version of the framework that they were using (Spring Boot 2.X), the environment in which the error occurred, all of the symptoms they could find, as well as included their full stack traces with error messages. The user then poses three separate questions asking about the origin of the errors, if the new update specifically caused this issue, and if there was an ideal solution rather than a temporary fix (what they have been currently doing). Under the thread, as it's quite new, there's only one reply from another user, however the answer provided was very well-formatted, specific, and effective. The user that provided the answer addressed all of the initial questions that the original post asked such as the background for why the errors occurr, as well as a step-by-step solution to the problem. They even added a TL;DR section to their reply!


## Example of a Not "Smart" Question

While reading through the Stack Overflow forum posts, I came across a question from the user *lizzyy*, posted on September 12th, 2025, they ask: ["How to mocking sql DB in Go"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79762681/how-to-mocking-sql-db-in-go)

From the title of the post, it's apparent that the question's grammar is a bit off. Moving past that, the question also seems broad as I tried running the question through ChatGPT to see if it was able to generate a sufficient answer and it ran into issues where it was not able to determine what type of SQL DB the user might have been referring to. Opening the post, the user posted their entire code followed with a description that did include a goal, however was followed up with another question that included a guess. They assume that an issue that is occurring might be related to something else within their code. Though I don't know what the post is talking about content-wise, it is quite confusing overall as it contained more confusing grammar. 

Looking at the answers that were on the post, the only one is from a user that simply typed, "have you tried to use sql mock?". This answer, in my opinion, does not seem very helpful as it poses another question to the user instead of describing clear help (though this is likely because the person who answered does not know the exact symptoms of the original user). It's clear that the original question was not smart enough, lacking in specifics while also containing poor grammar, that resulted in other users to make attempts at answering question, but ultimately not prove effective or efficient.

From comparing these two different types of questions, it's easy to see the difference in quality not only in questions being asked, but also the answers given by other users. It makes a lot of sense as users that spend more time drafting smart questions are usually met by other developers that are willing to spend as much if not more time drafting fitting responses; that'll address all of the question's needs.
