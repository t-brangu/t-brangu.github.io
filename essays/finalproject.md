## Overview
The Problem:<br>Throughout the semester, students at UH Manoa may lose countless items such as IDs, water bottles, textbooks, or even valuables such as their AirPods or other electronic devices. UH Manoa does have a Lost & Found system, but the current process consists of manually emailing departments, visiting physical locations like Campus Center, and making phone calls to said offices. It can be very inconsistent and students have no way of knowing when or if their items have been found without repeating this process numerous times.
<br>
<br>
The Solution:<br><strong>Manoa Lost & Found</strong> would be a <strong>digital platform for posting, searching, and aiding in the recovery of lost items</strong> on the UH campus. Users will be able to create posts for their lost items, adding images, tagging potential lost-at-locations, as well as leaving their contact information. For users that have found lost items, they will also be able to create posts for items that they have found, including images, and will be prompted to return the item to offical UH offices such as Campus Center. It connects finders and owners directly by UH authentification, organized item listings, dramatically improving lost-item recovery efficiency.
