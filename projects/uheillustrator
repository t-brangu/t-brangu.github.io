summary: "Contributing illustrator for University of Hawaii E-sports' content team."
---

During the 2024-2025 school year, I was a part of the University of Hawaii E-sports' content creation team. The content team is a community-driven group of volunteers that fulfill tasks and requests by the organization throughout the school year. I primarily focused on being an illustrator for the community as digital art and content creation is an interest that I have. There are also various other roles that I semi-fulfilled in prior years such as video editing and interests in broadcasting. As an illustrator for the content team, I worked with content leads and team leads for the various games we have at UHEsports. Games that I notably created content for at UHE was the *League of Legends team* and graphics for *Deadlock*.

Being an illustrator for the content team allowed me to develop communication skills as well as time management skills as everything that I was working on was project-based. I sent updates frequently to the team leads and they gave me feedback and suggestions. My updates would be weekly or even daily and I continued this workflow up until any of the content that I was working on was completed.

Here is an example of the League of Legends team's Lunar New Year commemorative illustration that was then posted onto UHE socials:

Here is another example of an emote I made for the UHE discord modeled by *Lady Geist* from the game *Deadlock*:
